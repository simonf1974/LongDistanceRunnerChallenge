## Java Class Challenge  
Build a class for a LongDistanceRunner. They have the following private attributes:  
​
### Attributes:  
energy level 0 - 10: int *note: could a setter be useful to set this limited range?*  
miles run: int  
daysSlept: int  
isHungry: boolean  
needsTheLoo: boolean  
isDead: boolean  
​
### Methods: 
constructor (define as needed)  
  
public run(int miles)  
    - reduces energy level by 1 for every two miles run.  
    - if has run 10 miles, isHungry becomes true  
    - if has run 14 miles, needsTheLoo becomes true  
    - if isHungry or needsTheLoo, the runner can't run until this is fixed  
    - if the runner has no energy, the runner dies.  
  
public eat()  
    - sets isHungry value to false  
    - reduces energy level by 1  
  
public wee()    
    - sets needsTheLoo to false  
    - reduces energy level by 1  
  
public sleep()  
    - recharges energy level to 10  
    - increments daysSlept  
  
*Use getters and setters to access your private attributes!*  
  
#### Extension  
Use the class to create a command line game that allows a user to control the runner and try and get them to run as far as possible in 5 days.  
  
#### Extension++  
Instantiate the class twice for two runners and have them run against each other, longest distance wins!
